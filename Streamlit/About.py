In this project I will walk you through how I used data science \
tools to solve a problem in the medical field. Let's dive right \
into it!

### Introduction

Biomedical signals have always played an important role in the medical field. \
One type of biomedical signal that you may be familiar with is an ECG or \
electrocardiogram. An ECG looks at how our heart functions by recording our \
heart rate and heart rhythm. Using these records, physicians can come to \
conclusions about whether a person is healthy or not, and if its the latter \
they can come up with a proper treatment outcome for the patient. 
            
### Problem Space

Traditionally, ECG signals are interpreted solely based on human \
readibility, and using these results doctors can pinpoint the next steps \
needed. However, this poses a risk in that although doctors are very \
professional in their line of work, they can make mistakes too. This can lead \
to misdiagnosis resulting in patients not receiving proper treatment. To \
counteract this issue, I proposed to use data science tools, specifically \
machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict ECG diagnostics.

st.markdown("""### A Brief Introduction to Fourier Transforms""")

st.markdown("""

Let me give you a brief introduction into what Fourier Transforms is and why 
we are talking about it! \

Fourier Transforms is a mathematical tool that is used in signal processing, 
and in our case the signal is the ECG itself. 
            
Often times when we are taking medical readings these signals can be obscured by
noise, that is signals not coming from the source we are trying to measure. When
recording ECG signals this might be in the form of the persons arm moving or 
body shifting when they are being recorded, or it can also come from our lungs
when we breath. These types of noise can make interpreting an ECG hard, and this
is where Fourier Transforms come in. 
            
Knowing that these signals have a certain pattern to them, we can explicitly 
remove them from our signal through the procedure of a Fourier Analysis. Signals
are usually taken over time. What Fourier Analysis does is look at what 
frequencies make up that signal instead of looking at it over time. Since we 
know that certain frequencies are associated with those noise, we can remove 
those frequencies being looking at the signal again over time.
