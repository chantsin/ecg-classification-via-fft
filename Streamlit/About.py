In this project I will walk you through how I used data science \
tools to solve a problem in the medical field. Let's dive right \
into it!

### Introduction

Biomedical signals have always played an important role in the medical field. \
One type of biomedical signal that you may be familiar with is an ECG or \
electrocardiogram. An ECG looks at how our heart functions by recording our \
heart rate and heart rhythm. Using these records, physicians can come to \
conclusions about whether a person is healthy or not, and if its the latter \
they can come up with a proper treatment outcome for the patient. 
            
### Problem Space

Traditionally, ECG signals are interpreted solely based on human \
readibility, and using these results doctors can pinpoint the next steps \
needed. However, this poses a risk in that although doctors are very \
professional in their line of work, they can make mistakes too. This can lead \
to misdiagnosis resulting in patients not receiving proper treatment. To \
counteract this issue, I proposed to use data science tools, specifically \
machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict ECG diagnostics.

# Create a sample ECG signal 
path = '../data/physionet.org/files/ptb-xl/1.0.3/records100/00000/'
ecg = '00004_lr'
file = path + ecg
metadata = pd.read_csv('../data/cleaned_metadata.csv', index_col=0)

signals, fields = wfdb.rdsamp(file, channels=[1])

sampling_frequency = fields['fs']  # Sampling frequency
sig_len = fields['sig_len'] # Signal length 
sig_name = fields['sig_name'] # Lead

time = np.arange(0, sig_len) / sampling_frequency

# First we get the sampling interval 
dt = 1/sampling_frequency

# Flatten the signal from 2D to 1D 
signals = signals.flatten()

# FFT returns a result not centered at zero, therefore we need to fftshift it to zero
signal_fft = np.fft.fftshift(np.fft.fft(signals) * dt)
freq = np.fft.fftshift(np.fft.fftfreq(sig_len, dt))

# Baseline removal
signal_bl = c.baseline_removal(signals, freq_start=0.1, freq_stop=1.5)

# Plotting sample ECG signal and the denoised version

    {
        'Time': time,
