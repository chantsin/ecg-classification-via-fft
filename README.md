# ECG Capstone

**Author**: Calvin Chan 

**Data**: The data set used for this project is called **PTB-XL** from **PhysioNet** and can be found [here](https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.3/).

The Capstone Repo contains a README file with pre-existing headers and bullet points to help guide your thoughts. You are required to fill this file in with a Project Overview. The overview should reflect the structure of your Areas of Interest Submission, explaining the Problem Area, including those affected, your proposed Data Science solution, the impact of your solution, and a description of your dataset. Any changes or refinements to your Area of Interest should be reflected in the README, and it is expected that your description of the data will be more granular (including a Data Dictionary if feasible) compared to the Area of Interest submission.

## Project Overview

A non-technical overview of the subject area and the problem statement / opportunity you identified
An overview of your proposed vision for tackling the problem using Data Science
An estimate of the potential impact of such a solution
An introduction to the dataset, including data quality concerns and findings from preliminary EDA.
Next steps in terms of data processing, feature engineering and baseline modeling.

Biomedical signals has always been an important aspect of the medical field. From medical diagnosis and treatment of patients to researching and developing drugs, it has helped many of those who were in need. An important aspect of why it works is because of its ability to capture many valuable information about the physiological state of the body that medical professions would not have known otherwise. However, whether this information is transferred to good use or not solely depends on the physicians ability to read the signal. In this project, we will be focusing on electrocardiograms (ECGs or EKGs) which is responsible for recording electrical activity in the heart. A systematic review
