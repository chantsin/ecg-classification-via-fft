## 1 - Project Overview

### Problem Area

Biomedical signals has always been an important aspect of the medical field. From medical diagnosis and treatment of patients to researching and developing drugs, it has helped many of those who were in need. An important aspect of why it works is because of its ability to capture many valuable information about the physiological state of the body that medical professions would not have known otherwise. However, whether this information is transferred to good use or not solely depends on the physicians ability to read the signal. In this project, we will be focusing on electrocardiograms (ECGs or EKGs) which is responsible for recording electrical activity in the heart. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2020 looked at 78 studies that assessed the accuracy of ECG interpretations by physicians with different levels of training and specialization, including medical students, residents, physicians in non-cardiology practice, and cardiologists. It was found that the accuracy scores varied significantly between the different physician levels, ranging from 4% to 95% [[1]](#1). This poses a significant problem for patients and specialists as different ECG results can lead to vastly different decision and outcomes. 

### Those Affected

This project can be significant if it is scaled to a larger setting. Being able to have access to this tool in a hospital setting should definitely help physicians of different levels to have better and more accurate diagnosis. It is possible to help medical students and residents in training when they are still learning about how to interpret ECG signals. In terms of business value, I believe this could also be implemented in current technologies. Imagine having a smart watch that would take your ECG on a regular basis and have feedback about your heart condition. This would be significant for people who may have unknown underlying heart conditions that have not seen a doctor yet. To have a device tell you that you may have an underlying condition advising you to see a physician can be lifesaving.

### Data Science Solution

In this project, we will attempt to utilize data science techniques to read ECG data and provide a diagnostic outcome, giving physicians and specialist an additional support for interpretation. More specifically, we will look into utilizing classification techniques used in data science to classify ECG signals into different diagnostic categories. This project can have a great impact on medical professionals as well as patients since it can act as an additional diagnostic confirmation, potentially decreasing diagostic errors made physicians allowing for more accurate and better treatment to patients. 

### Data Description

The dataset used for this project is called PTB-XL taken from PhysioNet. It contains 21799 12-lead ECG entries of 18869 unique patients collected using devices from Schiller AG. The signals were taken over the course of nearly seven years between October 1989 and June 1996. The dataset also contains a metadata file which includes patient information such as their sex, age, weight, as well as an annotation file which encodes the type of diagnosis for each ECG. 

### Data Dictionary
The dataset we are using includes two main metadata files, `ptbxl_database.csv` which we will call **Metadata** and it contains the patients information, and `scp_statements.csv` which we will call **Annotation** containing the official SCP-ECG statements for diagnosis. Below we present the data dictionary for each file.

## 3 - Notebooks
This project is divided into 5 main notebooks and are structured as follows. The notebooks are ordered by the number assigned to each and should be read in that order. 

1. **Metadata Annotations Cleaning**: 
This first notebook includes combining two data files, one with patient information and the other with the patients ECG diagnostic. We also implement some preliminary exploratory data analysis, taking a look inside what kind of data we are dealing with. 

2. **ECG Cleaning**:
In this next notebook, we go over the ECG signals and perform cleaning on them. The main tool we are using to clean our signals is Fourier Transforms, by implementing them into functions, we allow the user to explicitly remove frequency ranges in Fourier Space, effectively translating to signal denoising in time.

3. **Baseline Modeling**:
For baseline modeling, we use Logistic Regression and a Simple Neural Network as our choice. We utilize the method of binning our ECG signals based on amplitude before feeding them into our models. We also adjusted our target classes by dividing it into either multiclass classification or binary classification. 

4. **Autoencoders**:
As a detour, we experimented our works in autoencoders, utilizing the neural network architecture to see how much it can learn about ECG signals and whether it can reconstruct our input signals or not. Results indicate that it has trouble extracting important features in our data set without overfitting.

5. **Recurrent Neural Networks**:
This last notebook contains our advanced modeling where we use Recurrent Neural Networks to classify our data. Without using binning, we use the raw signals as RNNs process data in sequence allowing effect learning for time series signals like ours.

## 4 - Project Status

### Current Progress
This project has come to its ending phase. All notebooks are being uploaded and are available to the public subject to license restrictions. However, further updates are possible in the near future as there are more possible steps for this project. 

### Next steps 
As this project is ending its last phase, Convolutional Neural Networks have not been implemented yet. As such the next step would be to implement CNNs and see how they perform in contrast to RNNs and the other models.

## 5 - Setup

### Environment Download
To run the notebooks, the appropriate packages needs to be installed. We have included all the packages used for this project in the environment file `ecgcap.yml`. To download the environment on your computer, run the following code in your terminal
```
conda env create -n ecgcap -f ecgcap.yml
```

### Data Set Download
The data used for this project can be found in the PhysioNet link above, although the data folder can also be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ju1yhHguvVVcAEAf3lyz-NFchx71L54s?usp=drive_link) . With the data folder beside the other directories, the code cells in the notebooks should be running without issue.
